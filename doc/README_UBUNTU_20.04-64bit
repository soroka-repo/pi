###NOTE: Preface
     This is a working document of the progress on my PI project not all items
    are working, some text was taken from other users and adapted to run on UB 20.04 64bit,
    I shall add links to the original document to give credit to the original authors, 
    please forgive me if I missed a link... work in progress. The only editor I use is vi
    feel free to use your favorite except for those from Mickysoft that add extra unseen
    characters to the end of the line.

#
###PROCEDURE: Current Hardware / Software configuration
#
######################################################################

###STEP: Current Running Software: X=Install Complete, P=Partial install, U=not installed yet
 _X_ docker running: - Docker allows you to use Containoners- prepackaged applications the building blocks of the Cloud
   _P_  HomeAssistant - Smart Home Automation - installed, running internal website - needs SSL and DNS to run external website
        Need to add WireGuard to help with securing an external websight...
   _U_  Wireguard -
   _U_  Plex - Media server / steamer - not installed yet will try to use docer for the install
 _X_ Ubuntu Studio for high end audio and image processing, installed seem to go good, just tested "Hydrogen Advance Drum Machine" so far... 



###STEP: Current Hardware:
 _X_ Raspberry PI 4, Model B, 4GB SDRAM, added heatsinks and aluminum case, USB keyboard and mouse, HDMI cable and monitor,
      The aluminum case did not work with the wifi, with a aluminum case you will need an external wifi antenna
      which I may add but waiting to get the HIFIBerry in, which will sit on top of the PI so may need a new
      case...
 _X_ Power supply: remove the  Apple USBC power supply 5.0 @ 2.4A but PI recommends a 3.0A so may need an upgrade
                   waiting for the HIFIberry to come in since that may also drive a bigger supply
                   Now using an old IBM laptop supply 20V @3A plugged into the HIFIberry AMP and it powers it all 
 _X_ 64G microSD card current boot device
 _X_ 1TB SATA III disk drive in a SATA to USB 3.0 case media storage (future part of the RAID storage) 
 _X_ HIFIBerry Audio upgrade: PDAC+ ADC Pro $64, AAMP60 $49

 Upgrades: X=in use O=ordered, R=received, L=Looking
 _R_ 500G SATA III SSD drive, in a SATA III to USB 3.0 case to replace the 64G microSD card as the boot device  
 _R_ Cooling fan, but waiting for the hifiberry to arrive to figure out placement
 _L_ USB switch with extra power to support future RAID setup

#
###PROCEDURE: Some IDs that you will need to get
#
######################################################################


###STEP: ___ get an id on hub.docker.com we will use the docker hub to push any changes we make to the images for backup
#            or use to update other pi(s) it's free

###STEP: ___ get an id on github.com it will be used to store yaml files so you can setup the docker containers on other pi(s)
#            and the README insttuctions    



######################################################################
#
###PROCEDURE: Create the PI/UB computer UB 20.04 64bit
#
######################################################################


# load the Ubuntu 20.04 image to the micro SD card

###STEP: ___ write the ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-amd64+raspi.img to the SD card
#            grab the image from the Raspberry PI site and use your search engine to find the correct way to flash the image to the SD card


###STEP: ___ boot the SD username/password is ubuntu/ubuntu update to a strong password (like 16 characters or more
      # to SWITCH Desktops after you enter the the username click the gear in the lower left (oh maybe right) to choose the desktop
      # select xubuntu the other 2 (ubuntu and xfce) seem to get stuck with a blank screen

###STEP: ___ verify that you got a dhcp assigned IP addr
 ip addr;

###STEP: ___ update, upgrade and install 
#            (yes everyone else uses apt-get but why type the extra characters when apt works just fine)
 sudo su;
 apt update;
 apt upgrade; ### upgrade may fail with a lock due to UB's auto upgrade running just keep trying "apt update" until no further packages are 
              ### installed then run "apt upgrade" again

 apt install net-tools xubuntu-desktop ksh -y; ### install xubuntu, I picked gdm3 (mistake) You should pick lightdm it uses less mem
                                               ### install net-tools since I still like typing ifconfig and ksh because I'm old and that's my shell
 apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras; ### install media codecs, fonts... all the stuff that UB does not like to install because it may not be completely open source
 reboot;

###STEP: ___ change the userid from ubuntu to your own id
#          example will show userid "joeuser", this is for security the hackers will try "ubuntu" and warning screw this up and you will not be able to log in
#          but you can re-flash your SD and try try again
 sudo su;
 cd /etc;
 for i in "passwd" "group" "shadow" "gshadow"; do sed 's/ubuntu/joeuser/g' -i $i; done;
 sed 's/Ubuntu/joeuser/g' -i /etc/passwd;
 mv /home/ubuntu /home/joeuser;
 reboot; ### just to make sure you did it correctly and we can still log on otherwise it's a re-flash

###STEP: ___ set the IP address to static
#     so it will always be the same, I have 2 networks one for wired and one for wireless
#     the raspberry PI is connected to both networks and the default gateway (routes) are set to work if either
#     network is down or both up, we will also be diabling UB's Cloud.cfg which seems to hang up some/most of the time 
#
#
# list network interfaces of the PI just to see what you have
 ls /sys/class/net;


# use netplan (see: man netplan) to configure the nework it will support all the possible network configurations that you can think of
# allow NetworkManager to manage netplan it works well with the extra networks docker will add. Move /etc/netplan/50-cloud-int.yaml to
# /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml or remove the 50-cloud-int.yaml we only want 01-netcfg.yaml in the /etc/netplan dir.


 sudo mv /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml;
 sudo vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml; ### change it from: to: observing correct yaml column formatting

###EXAMPLE: From: cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml UB's  default
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2
###EXAMPLE_END:


###to: this is what I have, change the IPs addrs as needed, replace the XXXX.. in wlan0 with your WIFI network and password
#      change the mac address to your mac in the match this is here to make sure eth0 name got changed on boot
#      change the routes and nameserver ip from 192.168.2[3].1 to your correct gateway, first time editing a *.yaml file the 
#      leading indents/spaces must be perfect (oh dreams of COBOL coding long long ago)


###EXAMPLE: TO: cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml your ne config
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      match:
        macaddress: dc:a6:32:XX:XX:XX

      nameservers:
        addresses: [192.168.2.1,8.8.8.8]
      optional: true
      routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0/0
          via: 192.168.1.1
          metric: 100

        - to: 0.0.0.0/0
          via: 192.168.3.1
          metric: 100
###EXAMPLE_END:


# create the file /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
# with just the line network: {config: disabled}
# this is needed to keep the cloud config stuff from trying to reconfigure the network
#
###EXAMPLE: cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg 
network: {config: disabled}
###EXAMPLE_END:

 netplan apply; ### this will test and apply your new /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml network config file
#or*
 netplan try; ### this will try it and then roll it back if you messed up nice if you are working remote to the server(PI)
   

# reboot and test your network works
 reboot;



###STEP: ___ change the hostname 
#     from: ubuntu to: something meaningful to you, this is also for security the hackers will look for hostname "ubuntu"
#     it will tell them right away what OS you are running 
 hostnamectl set-hostname <new_host_name>;



# you should now have a working PI computer ready to compete with any laptop,desktop,phone,tablet,server,cluster,super computer...

Connecting Node-RED to HA is as easy as loading the proper modules into Node-RED.

On the Node-RED webpage, click the hamburger button in the upper-right corner and select "Manage palette".

Click the "Install" tab

Where it says "search modules", enter "home-assistant"

You want the one that says "node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket", currently at version 0.1.3

Click the install button

Click the install button on the warning that pops up

 
When you see a green box pop up, listing the new nodes that are added to the palette, it's done installing.

 
The first time you try to use the Home Assistant nodes, there will be errors. This is normal. Errors will be thrown and HA entity names will not show up automatically until the nodes are properly configured (pointing at your HA install with http://YOUR.PI.IP.ADDRESS:8123 and a Long-Lived Access Token) AND you hit "Deploy" at the upper-right.

 
You get a Long-Lived Access Token from Home Assistant by clicking on the round Profile button in the upper left of the HA interface. If the username you created in HA is "Bob", you should see a circle around a "B". Click that.

 
At the bottom of the profile page, you'll see an option to create a Long-Lived Access Token. Give it a meaningful name, like "Node-RED", and copy the text of the token. Paste this text into the "Edit server node" section of Node-RED, where it says "Access Token".

 
Use of Node-RED for HA automation is for another discussion, but at least now you can get started. :-)

###PROCEDURE: UB 20.04 DEBUGGING ERRORS on the PI-4 4g mem
#
######################################################################
# Do each of the following steps to correct problems with the PI-4 running UB 20.04


###STEP: DEBUGGING: conserve mem
## ___ install google chromium, chromium uses about 10M per tab compared firefox 100M / tab of mem usage
 sudo apt update;
 sudo apt install chromium-browser;




###STEP: DEBUGGING: DT hang and conserve mem  
# ___ xubuntu running gdm3 is hanging or going blank when running gdm3
# switch the desktop from gdm3 to lightdm the xubuntu desktp keeps freezing when you leave it inactive????
#recover from a hung desktop
 <ctrl><alt>f3
 login and run
 sudo systemctl restart gdm
 <ctrl><alt>f1 ### to log back into the gui

# FIXED: change from gdm to lightdm and see it that hangs
 sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm;
 reboot;
## lightdm is also using less mem also better for the PI
## the mem usage has dropped with lightdm to 1G while gdm3 was using about 3.5G so much better 




###STEP: DEBUGING: DT hang
# ___ lightdm no mouse click or keyboard input
# it seems like the screensaver is what is broken
#
### FIXED: install xscreensaver and turn off lightdm's screensaver it's buggy with the PI maybe problems with powersaver on the PI...

 apt install xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra;
 systemctl restart lightdm;
#turn off light locker settings go to 
   Applications
    Settings
     Light Locker Settings ### turn it off
#turn on xscreensaver
   Applications
    Settings
     screensaver # set the mode "Blank or Only One or Ransom",  set the time "Blank After x minutes"

### remove the light-locker screen saver
 apt remove light-locker light-locker-settings




###STEP: DEBUGGING: wifi network down
# ___ noticed wifi interface is down overnight
# restart network
 systemctl restart NetworkManager

# wlan0 network is back up, Maybe it was the buggy light locker screensaver putting the wifi in power save mode
# wait and see... still gone while using xscreensaver... lets see if it goes away at screen saver time??? nope
# OUCH: is it my nice aluminum case the PI is in messing up the wifi signal??? case is open now see what happens...
#      looking better oh well the case has to go when the hifiberry hat arrives, maybe need to add a U.FL connector
#      and an external wifi antenna....





######################################################################
#
###PROCEDURE: NEW options to figure out:
#
######################################################################

###STEP: ADD: wireguard = is the VPN for UB20 apt install wireguard, and there are docker images
###STEP: Complete: the hifiberry PRO ADC/DAC and AMP when it arrives
###STEP: ADD: Plex with docker, add a better mount for the USB drive
###STEP: ADD: get the PI-4 to boot with a USB 3.0 SATA III SSD without the SD card
###STEP: ADD: swap space on the SSD for the PI
###STEP: ADD: cooling fan and overclock
###STEP: ADD: external uFL wifi connector
###STEP: ADD: is the bluetooth working???? may need an antenna to extend it's range it works better with case lid off
